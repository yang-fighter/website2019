Join Meeting
============

Before you click **Join meeting** button, I suggest you to change the audio option to *Call me at*, as follows

Type your cell phone number in the blank and click *Call me at*. Then you will receive a call from Webex, answer it and press 1 on your phone, then you can hear the class. The reason I suggest you to change the audio to phone is that the computer audio depends on the internet connection and sometimes it will be in and out. But the phone will guarantee the quality of voice.

If the **passcode** is asked to join the meeting, check the announcement in WTClass to find it.
