Echelon Forms
=============

A matrix that have the following properties is in **row echelon form**:

#. If a row does not consist entirely of zeros, then the first nonzero
   number in the row is a 1. We call this a leading 1.

#. If there are any rows that consist entirely of zeros, then they are
   grouped together at the bottom of the matrix.

#. In any two successive rows that do not consist entirely of zeros, the
   leading 1 in the lower row occurs farther to the right than the
   leading 1 in the higher row.

A row echelon row form matrix is in **reduced row echelon form** if each
column that contains a leading 1 has zeros everywhere else in that
column.

In a linear system, the variables corresponding to the leading 1’s in
the augmented matrix, we call these the **leading variables**. The
remaining variables are called **free variables**.

Are the following matrices in row echelon form? If so, are they in
reduced row echelon form?

:math:`x_1,x_2,x_3` and :math:`x_4` has been reduced by elementary row
operations to

operations to the given reduced row echelon form. Solve the system.

Elimination Methods
===================

We have just seen how easy it is to solve a system of linear equations
once its augmented matrix is in reduced row echelon form. Now we will
give a step-by-step elimination procedure that can be used to reduce any
matrix to reduced row echelon form.

Reduce the following matrix to reduced row echelon form.

.. math::

   \begin{bmatrix}
         0&0& -2&0& 7&12\\
         2&4&-10&6&12&28\\
         2&4& -5&6&-5&-1
       \end{bmatrix}

#. Locate the leftmost column that does not consist entirely of zeros.

#. Interchange the top row with another row, if necessary, to bring a
   nonzero entry to the top of the column found in Step 1.

#. If the entry that is now at the top of the column found in Step 1 is
   :math:`a`, multiply the first row by :math:`\frac{1}{a}` in order to
   introduce a leading 1.

#. Add suitable multiples of the top row to the rows below so that all
   entries below the leading 1 become zeros.

#. Now cover the top row in the matrix and begin again with Step 1
   applied to the submatrix that remains. Continue in this way until the
   entire matrix is in row echelon form.

#. Beginning with the last nonzero row and working upward, add
   suitablemultiples of each row to the rows above to introduce zeros
   above the leading 1’s.

Step 1-5 produces a row echelon form and is called **Gaussian
elimination**. Step 1-6 produces a reduced row echelon form and is
called **Gaussian-Jordan elimination**.

Solve by Gauss–Jordan elimination.

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
         x_1+3x_2-2x_3+2x_5&=0\\
         2x_1+6x_2-5x_3-2x_4+4x_5-3x_6&=-1\\
         5x_3+10x_4+15x_6&=5\\
         2x_1+6x_2+8x_4+4x_5+18x_6&=6
       \end{aligned}

Homogeneous Linear Systems
==========================

A system of linear equations is said to be **homogeneous** if the
constant terms are all zero; that is, the system has the form

.. math::

   \label{ax=0}
       \begin{aligned}
         a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2+\cdots+a_{1n}x_n&=0\\
         a_{21}x_1+a_{22}x_2+\cdots+a_{2n}x_n&=0\\
         \vdots\\
         a_{m1}x_1+a_{m2}x_2+\cdots+a_{mn}x_n&=0
       \end{aligned}

Since the m-tuple :math:`(0,0,\cdots,0)` is a solution of Eq
`[ax=0] <#ax=0>`__, every homogeneous system of linear equations is
consistent. This solution is called the **trivial solution**; if there
are other solutions, they are called **nontrivial solutions**.

Because a homogeneous linear system always has the trivial solution,
there are only two possibilities for its solutions:

-  The system has only the trivial solution.

-  The system has infinitely many solutions in addition to the trivial
   solution.

Use Gauss–Jordan elimination to solve the homogeneous linear system

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
         x_1+3x_2-2x_3+2x_5&=0\\
         2x_1+6x_2-5x_3-2x_4+4x_5-3x_6&=0\\
         5x_3+10x_4+15x_6&=0\\
         2x_1+6x_2+8x_4+4x_5+18x_6&=0
       \end{aligned}

   \vspace{5cm}

If a homogeneous linear system has n unknowns, and if the reduced row
echelon form of its augmented matrix has r nonzero rows, then the system
has :math:`n-r` free variables.

A homogeneous linear system with more unknowns than equations has
infinitely many solutions.

There are three facts about row echelon forms and reduced row echelon
forms:

-  Every matrix has a unique reduced row echelon form.

-  Row echelon forms are not unique.

-  Although row echelon forms are not unique, the reduced row echelon
   form and all row echelon forms of a matrix *A* have the same number
   of zero rows, and the leading 1’s always occur in the same positions.
   Those are called the **pivot positions** of *A*. A column that
   contains a pivot position is called a **pivot column** of *A*.

 True or False.

If a matrix is in reduced row echelon form, then it is also in row
echelon form. If an elementary row operation is applied to a matrix that
is in row echelon form, the resulting matrix will still be in row
echelon form. Every matrix has a unique row echelon form. A homogeneous
linear system in *n* unknowns whose corresponding augmented matrix has a
reduced row echelon form with *r* leading 1’s has :math:`n-r` free
variables. All leading 1’s in a matrix in row echelon form must occur in
different columns. If every column of a matrix in row echelon form has a
leading 1, then all entries that are not leading 1’s are zero. If a
homogeneous linear system of *n* equations in *n* unknowns has a
corresponding augmented matrix with a reduced row echelon form
containing *n* leading 1’s, then the linear system has only the trivial
solution. If the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix for a
linear system has a row of zeros, then the system must have infinitely
many solutions. If a linear system has more unknowns than equations,
then it must have infinitely many solutions.
