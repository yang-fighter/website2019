Echelon Forms

.. proof:definition:: row echelon form

   A matrix that have the following properties is in **row echelon form**:

   #. If a row does not consist entirely of zeros, then the first nonzero
      number in the row is a 1. We call this a **leading 1**.

   #. If there are any rows that consist entirely of zeros, then they are
      grouped together at the bottom of the matrix.

   #. In any two successive rows that do not consist entirely of zeros, the
      leading 1 in the lower row occurs farther to the right than the
      leading 1 in the higher row.

.. proof:definition:: reduced row echelon form

   A row echelon row form matrix is in **reduced row echelon form** if each
   column that contains a leading 1 has zeros everywhere else in that
   column.

.. proof:definition:: leading variables and free variables

   In a linear system, the variables corresponding to the leading 1’s in
   the augmented matrix, we call these the **leading variables**. The
   remaining variables are called **free variables**.

.. proof:example::

   Are the following matrices in row echelon form? If so, are they in
   reduced row echelon form?

   
   .. multicol::
      :columns: 4

      #) :math:`\begin{bmatrix}      1&0&0&4\\      0&1&0&7\\      0&0&1&-1   \end{bmatrix}`

      #) :math:`\begin{bmatrix}     1&0&0\\     0&1&0\\     0&0&1  \end{bmatrix}`
            
      #) :math:`\begin{bmatrix}     1&4&-3&7\\     0&1&6&2\\     0&0&1&5  \end{bmatrix}`
            
      #) :math:`\begin{bmatrix}     1&1&0\\     0&1&0\\     0&0&0  \end{bmatrix}`
            
      #) :math:`\begin{bmatrix}      0&1&2&6&0\\      0&0&1&-1&0\\      0&0&0&0&1   \end{bmatrix}`
            
      #) :math:`\begin{bmatrix}      0&-1&2&0&1\\      0&0&0&1&3\\      0&0&0&0&0\\      0&0&0&0&0   \end{bmatrix}`
            
      #) :math:`\begin{bmatrix}       0&0\\       0&0    \end{bmatrix}`
            
      #) :math:`\begin{bmatrix}     0&1\\     1&0  \end{bmatrix}`

.. proof:example::

   Suppose that the augmented matrix for a linear system in the unknowns :math:`x_1,x_2,x_3` and :math:`x_4` has been reduced by elementary row
   operations to

   .. math::

      \begin{bmatrix}
            1&0&0&0&3\\
            0&1&0&0&-1\\
            0&0&1&0&0\\
            0&0&0&1&5
      \end{bmatrix}

   Find the solution of the linear system.

.. proof:example::

   In each part, suppose that the augmented matrix for a linear system in the unknowns *x*, *y*, and *z* has been reduced by elementary row
   operations to the given reduced row echelon form. Solve the system.

   .. multicol::
      :columns: 3

      (a) :math:`\begin{bmatrix}      1&0&0&0\\      0&1&2&0\\      0&0&0&1    \end{bmatrix}`
      (b) :math:`\begin{bmatrix}      1&0&3&-1\\      0&1&-4&2\\      0&0&0&0    \end{bmatrix}`
      (c) :math:`\begin{bmatrix}      1&-5&1&4\\      0&0&0&0\\      0&0&0&0    \end{bmatrix}`


Elimination Methods
===================

We have just seen how easy it is to solve a system of linear equations
once its augmented matrix is in reduced row echelon form. Now we will
give a step-by-step elimination procedure that can be used to reduce any
matrix to reduced row echelon form.

.. proof:example::

   Reduce the following matrix to reduced row echelon form.

   .. math::

      \begin{bmatrix}
         0&0& -2&0& 7&12\\
         2&4&-10&6&12&28\\
         2&4& -5&6&-5&-1
      \end{bmatrix}

   .. toggle-header::
      :header: **Solution:**

      #. Locate the leftmost column that does not consist entirely of zeros.
      #. Interchange the top row with another row, if necessary, to bring a nonzero entry to the top of the column found in Step 1.
      #. If the entry that is now at the top of the column found in Step 1 is :math:`a`, multiply the first row by :math:`\frac{1}{a}` in order to introduce a leading 1.
      #. Add suitable multiples of the top row to the rows below so that all entries below the leading 1 become zeros.
      #. Now cover the top row in the matrix and begin again with Step 1 applied to the submatrix that remains. Continue in this way until the entire matrix is in row echelon form.
      #. Beginning with the last nonzero row and working upward, add suitable multiples of each row to the rows above to introduce zeros above the leading 1’s.

.. proof:definition::

   Step 1-5 produces a row echelon form and is called **Gaussian elimination**. Step 1-6 produces a reduced row echelon form and is called **Gaussian-Jordan elimination**.

.. proof:example::

   Solve by Gauss–Jordan elimination.

   .. math::

      \begin{aligned}
         x_1+3x_2-2x_3+2x_5&=0\\
         2x_1+6x_2-5x_3-2x_4+4x_5-3x_6&=-1\\
         5x_3+10x_4+15x_6&=5\\
         2x_1+6x_2+8x_4+4x_5+18x_6&=6
      \end{aligned}


Homogeneous Linear Systems
==========================

.. proof:definition::

   A system of linear equations is said to be **homogeneous** if the
   constant terms are all zero; that is, the system has the form

   .. math::
      :label: ax=0

      \begin{aligned}
         a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2+\cdots+a_{1n}x_n&=0\\
         a_{21}x_1+a_{22}x_2+\cdots+a_{2n}x_n&=0\\
         \vdots\\
         a_{m1}x_1+a_{m2}x_2+\cdots+a_{mn}x_n&=0
      \end{aligned}

.. proof:definition::

   Since the m-tuple :math:`(0,0,\cdots,0)` is a solution of :eq:`ax=0`, every homogeneous system of linear equations is
   consistent. This solution is called the **trivial solution**; if there
   are other solutions, they are called **nontrivial solutions**.

.. note::

   Because a homogeneous linear system always has the trivial solution,
   there are only two possibilities for its solutions:

   -  The system has only the trivial solution.

   -  The system has infinitely many solutions in addition to the trivial
      solution.

.. proof:example::

   Use Gauss–Jordan elimination to solve the homogeneous linear system

   .. math::

      \begin{aligned}
            x_1+3x_2-2x_3+2x_5&=0\\
            2x_1+6x_2-5x_3-2x_4+4x_5-3x_6&=0\\
            5x_3+10x_4+15x_6&=0\\
            2x_1+6x_2+8x_4+4x_5+18x_6&=0
         \end{aligned}

.. proof:theorem::

   If a homogeneous linear system has n unknowns, and if the reduced row
   echelon form of its augmented matrix has r nonzero rows, then the system
   has :math:`n-r` free variables.

.. proof:theorem::

   A homogeneous linear system with more unknowns than equations has
   infinitely many solutions.

There are three facts about row echelon forms and reduced row echelon
forms:

-  Every matrix has a unique reduced row echelon form.

-  Row echelon forms are not unique.

-  Although row echelon forms are not unique, the reduced row echelon
   form and all row echelon forms of a matrix *A* have the same number
   of zero rows, and the leading 1’s always occur in the same positions.
   Those are called the **pivot positions** of *A*. A column that contains a pivot position is called a **pivot column** of *A*.
